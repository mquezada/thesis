\chapter{Introduction}

% WHAT IS SOCIAL MEDIA

The so-called {\em Web 2.0} represents a change in how users interact with the
Web.
%
Currently, the Web acts as a system that encourages end-users to publish and
consume content. 
%
One of the main manifestations of this phenomena are {\em online social
networks}.
%
Users make connections with other users online based on different criteria, and
start to produce content.
%
Social platforms such as Facebook~\cite{facebook}, Twitter~\cite{twitter},
or Sina Weibo~\cite{weibo} are now among the most used ways to connect with
family, friends, acquaintances, co-workers, or strangers with similar interests.
%
Users interact with each other and produce or share content about their lives,
thoughts, or what is happening around the world, etc.    
%
This collective of information published in these Internet-based applications,
such as microblogging platforms, blogs, wikis, etc., is called {\em
social media}~\cite{kaplan2010users}.

%%
% CONTENT IN SM

Content in social media is multimodal. 
%
Twitter, for example, encourages users to publish short texts (initially limited
to 140 characters, now 280), but it recently started to promote that users share
more photographs~\cite{brown_2019}.
%  
And with the proliferation of smartphones and internet-connected devices, more
of this information is also geo-tagged and in ``real-time''. 
%
For instance, Foursquare~\cite{foursquare} is an application for smartphone
users to tag and comment about locations around the world, which became a
repository of data about businesses and points of interest.
%
Whether via text, images, videos, sounds or hyperlinks, social media lowered the
entry barriers for content producers and made it easy for consumers to access a
myriad of different pieces of information.


%%


% UTILITY, APPLICATIONS OF SM

The influence of social media on today's society cannot be denied, as it
facilitates co\-mmu\-nication among people and speeds up the diffusion of
information. 
%
For instance, it is believed that the revolutionary wave of protests and
uprisings in the Arab states (known as the Arab Spring, which began in 2010) was
highly influenced by social media as a means of organizing and facilitating
communication~\cite{howard2011opening}. 
%
Also, it has permitted many applications to proliferate in emergency management
and detection, such as earthquake alert systems using
Twitter~\cite{Sakaki2010,Sakaki:Tweet:2013,Sarmiento:2018:DDE:3201064.3201077,Mendoza2019}.
%
The usefulness of quantitative analysis of events through time is undeniable, and
social media offers a window to see and capture information about those events,
how they develop, and how the world interprets them.\\

%%% DEFINITION OF EVENT:
We define an {\bf event} as a conglomerate of information that encompasses all
of the social media content related to a real-world news occurrence. 
%
We will use this specification throughout this work, which considers an event as
a complex unit of information, in contrast to other interpretations, such as
those that consider an event as represented by a single unit or piece of
information, like a news article, a video, or a structured and pre-defined
description.

% NEWS CONSUMPTION AND PRODUCTION
One of the main uses of social media platforms is the consumption and generation
of real-world event-related content. 
%
According to a recent 2018 study~\cite{pewresearch}, about two thirds of adults
in the U.S. obtain their news from social media.
%
The most used platforms for news are Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter, with the
latter having over 70\% of its users using the platform to consume news.
%
Furthermore, almost every news outlet has a presence in social media
in order to attract readers and viewers.
%
In this way, users comment on the news events, reacting to them according to a
myriad of factors, and many of these characteristics are present in one way or
another in social media.
%
Therefore, we see social media as a medium that reflects an important 
part of what society thinks about what is happening in the world.




% PROBLEMS

However, the popularity of social media is not without issues. 
%
{\em Information overload} refers to the problem of being unable to manage or to
make decisions based on data, due to the high volume of information available
and the limited capabilities of the person who is dealing with it. 
%
Humans have limited cognitive processing capacities, and when they are
overloaded with information, their quality of decision making
suffers~\cite{gross1964managing}. 
%
In the context of social media, the high availability of diverse information may
prevent users from finding relevant content.

%%

Finding relevant content in social media is not easily solved by conventional
search engines.
%
Social media publications, or {\em posts}, can be of {\em variable quality}.
%
Posts are composed of multimedia pieces of content, but often they are brief.
%
For instance, a post can be a very short text, an hyperlink, a single image or
video with little context.
%
They can be also irrelevant to the interest of a particular user, for example,
spam posts, which are posts that contain relevant keywords but in a misleading way, in
order to lure users to irrelevant websites. 
%
Posts can also be out-dated, delivering incorrect or obsolete information. 
%
Many posts can be duplicates, published by automated agents, or by users
using ``share buttons'' in websites publishing posts with a template text; 
%
they can also be near-duplicates, with minor text differences, or sharing the
same resource from different URLs.
%
Another important characteristic of posts is that they are written in natural
language, so they can be incorrectly capitalized, misspelled, or with ambiguous
meaning.
%
Users make use of colloquial language and different forms of expression when
publishing content, e.g., abbreviations, hashtags (tags to describe content),
emojis (ideograms), etc.
%
Finally, messages can also be misleading, sharing false information.
%
All of these particularities of social media make it difficult to apply standard
techniques for users to find relevant content.

%%

At the same time, there is a massive scale of content production.
%
Twitter reports that there are about 320 million monthly active users and 500
million {\em tweets} daily\footnote{These numbers were first stated in 2014 and
have not been updated since then.}, i.e., messages published in their
platform~\cite{twitter2014}. 
%
Facebook has nearly 2.32 billion monthly active users~\cite{fbnewsroom}. 
%
Sina Weibo has 462 million monthly active users, where 93\% of them are on
mobile devices~\cite{chinawatch}.
%
The amount of content being published requires novel ways to deal with social
media data, in particular, news events.


%%

%We define a news event as a higher-level abstraction composed of individual
%posts about a real-world occurrence.\todo[inline]{mejor sacar esta frase se repite despues}
%
In related work, an event\footnote{In this work, we will use the term {\em news
event} and {\em event} interchangeably.} is deemed as {\em something that happens
in a certain place and time}~\cite{yang1999learning}, while other definitions
consider an event as a collection of documents related to a certain
occurrence~\cite{Becker:2010:LSM:1718487.1718524}.
%
Throughout this thesis, we will consider an event as a collection of
social media posts describing or commenting on a real-world occurrence.
%
In this sense, an event is a more complex piece of information compared to
single posts.
%
This notion of event is useful as it is the base unit for new tasks, such as
event detection, tracking, or summarization.
%
Also, an event is comprised of posts of heterogeneous quality, from different
locations, and at different times.
%
This yields new problems and challenges when studying social media.

% PROPOSAL

\section{Objectives}

In this thesis we tackle the problem of {\em extracting useful
knowledge} from events on social media. 
%
To be able to infer and extract useful information from events, we propose the
creation of event representations that leverage specific features according
to the desired goal when analyzing social media data.
%
For this, we propose different models or representations of events based on
three perspectives:
%

\begin{enumerate}
    \item {\bf User activity.} 
    %
    When users react to an event, they may manifest this reaction on social
    media, producing or sharing content relevant to the event. 
    %
    The characteristics of these manifestations are dependent on the particular
    features of the occurrence, and not all are equal. 
    %
    We look at how the activity of users offers insight on the specific
    features of an event and incorporates this behavior in a compact
    representation.

    \item {\bf Spatio-temporal context.} 
    %
    Events occur in different locations. 
    %
    On the other hand, users from different locations may react differently to
    the same event.
    % 
    We study the evolution of events based on user activity conditioned by the
    location users are from, proposing a representation of events and locations
    based on social media posts.

    \item {\bf Content.} 
    %
    Users may publish similar pieces of content in social media in reaction to
    events.
    %
    However, each post can contribute to a different aspect of the event, while
    sharing some common features.
    %
    We leverage these commonalities in content in order to produce a compact model that
    preserves topical information in events.
    
\end{enumerate}


% OBJETIVES

Our main objective is to define event representations through different data
aggregations in order to perform quantitative analysis of news events on social media.
%
Currently, it is very difficult to manage and analyze the high volume of
information being published when an event occurs. 
%
In particular, we study events through three perspectives: user reaction
and activity, spatio-temporal context of events, and content aggregation.
%
Understanding user reaction involves discriminating which events are more
important or produce more impact in a community. 
%
Analyzing spatio-temporal context refers to understanding how communities from
different locations are affected by different events, as seen on social media,
and identifying similar communities and events based on this context. 
%
Understanding content refers to the identification of the core aspects of an
event, without having to go through all the --potentially many-- posts.
%
In particular, our goal is to propose different models for representing events. 
%
These models should be flexible enough to apply diverse methodologies to
discover useful knowledge from information published on social media about
real-world events, from the perspectives described above. 


%%

% WHY TWITTER
\section{Why Twitter?} 

We chose Twitter as our data source for this work. 
%
The majority of Twitter posts are, in general, public, and data can be obtained
in a simple way automatically via its API (Application Programming
Interface~\cite{twitterapi}).
%
Furthermore, it is not as restrictive as other platforms, such as Facebook,
in which users maintain a private profile.
%
Also, Facebook encourages users to share more personal content, and not just
event-related.
%
Twitter, on the other hand, is primarily dedicated to share event-related posts,
and it is mostly utilized as a news source by about 70\% of its users. 
%
For instance, its website asks ``What's happening?'' to users when publishing
content, as opposed to Facebook's ``What's on your mind?''


% UTILITY
\section{Applications}

The study of news event dissemination in online social networks has several
applications in the proposed setting. 
%
How the community reacts to different real-world phenomena can allow us to
characterize those events,
%
for example, by measuring user reaction, other social network features, or
analyzing event content.
%
Using these characteristics, we would be able to identify or even predict which
events are going to cause a significant reaction from the community, hence
improving journalistic coverage or providing better response from authorities in
face of an emergency.
%
Additionally, by studying not only the response, but the context of different
communities and how they respond to certain events, we may gain insights about
the communities themselves, for example, by revealing unexpected relations
between different communities, or by measuring event similarity using the
context, instead of content-based features. 
%
On the other hand, the study of the content is useful to understand the
different points of view ahead of an event. 
%
Users accustomed to the same perspectives given by other users or sources may be
oblivious of other information angles of the same news event. 
%
Being capable of identifying different aspects that compose an event and then
presenting these aspects in a concise summary can deal with this problem. 
%
All in all, the proposed framework can be of utility to understand social
behavior, study and decrease the effects of the information overload as well
as to perform comparative historical research~\cite{wiki:comparative}.

\section{Thesis statement} 
%
This dissertation defines flexible models for events on the social
networking platform Twitter. 
%
Having three perspectives in mind: user reaction, spatio-temporal context, and
content, the defined models should be able to allow us to achieve new insights
about real-world events as seen by Twitter users. 
%
In particular, each perspective approaches a specific Data Mining and Information
Retrieval technique: 
%
the study of context involves modeling and exploratory data analysis; 
%
reaction analysis involves filtering and classification;
%
content involves topic detection and document modeling.
%
The proposed models are designed to be general and easily adaptable to other
online social networks.

The thesis statement is as follows:

\section{Challenges} 

We identify three main challenges for this work:

\begin{itemize}
    \item {\bf Retrieval of relevant social media posts.} 
    Mainstream topics obfuscate distinct points of view, which can
    obstruct retrieval of diverse and relevant content to an event. 
    %
    Here, relevance to a topic is defined as the similarity between a piece of
    content and the topic which this piece refers to.
    %
    Because users are frequently posting messages about their own lives, daily
    situations, or general topics, trends can only be visible when looking at large
    volumes of data. 
    %
    This makes identification of events and relevant content a very difficult task.
    %
    Due to the characteristics of Twitter (or any other online social network),
    messages are usually very short and noisy.
    %
    Users spontaneously create new ways to refer to the same entities
    (e.g., via the use of hashtags, emojis, or abbreviations), making it
    difficult to identify more relevant content when detecting events.
    %
    Relevant multimedia content is also difficult to identify. 
    %
    Multimedia content is represented by images, videos, text, or a mix of them,
    etc. 
    %
    This information can be exploited to improve the effectiveness of
    the proposed methodologies. 
    %
    The challenge consists of how to identify such content in an efficient way,
    how to deal with duplicated or quasi-duplicated content, and how to evaluate
    the effectiveness of methodologies when presenting multimedia content. 

    \item {\bf Bias in the collected data.}
    Social media offers a partial view of the world. 
    %
    Furthermore, the employed methodologies to retrieve or identify events from
    social media may be biased depending on several factors. 
    %
    For instance, we collected our dataset using news outlets as sources, with
    the majority of outlets coming from the USA or the UK. 
    %
    Our sources also use specific words and ways to express the information,
    which can also create a bias in the way we further retrieve more tweets.
    %
    This is a huge challenge in order to provide generalizable results from the
    proposed methodologies. 
    %
    In addition, it is challenging to ensure that our results are as diverse as
    the data source. 

    \item {\bf Validation of results.} 
    As data in social media is being published at all times, it is unfeasible to
    apply standard measures such as Recall when evaluating a methodology,
    because we do not have all the relevant content available.
    %
    On the other hand, there are no {\em gold standards} to which we can
    contrast our models. 
    %
    We need to come up with methodologies to validate our results in order to
    provide generalizable results.
    
\end{itemize}


\paragraph{A note on the veracity of the data.} 
%
Misinformation, fabricated content, and automated tools to publish content at
large scale correspond to an important challenge when analyzing social media
information.
%
In this work we apply simple measures to avoid some forms of non-relevant
content, such as the removal of messages that share several URLs at the same
time, hashtags, etc.
%
We also make the assumption that the events we collected (see
Chapter~\ref{chapter:data}) correspond to real-world occurrences reported by
verified and recognized news outlets.
%
The identification and characterization of misleading information is an active
line of research at the time of this dissertation, but we do not apply more
sophisticated techniques to tackle this potential issue.
%
We discuss further this issue when discussing the bias in our data in
Section~\ref{sec:geo:mining} and in Chapter~\ref{sec:conclusions}.



\section{Contributions} 

This thesis presents four main contributions, as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \setlength\itemsep{0.5em}

\item A novel representation of event information based on user activity
triggered by real-world events in Twitter (Chapter~\ref{chapter:high-activity}).
%
This representation allows us to rank events into different levels of user
activity. 
%
We also show that the activity can be determined by other event features, and
that these features appear early during event evolution.
%
We show that it is possible to {\em predict} early on the level of activity that
an event will produce using aggregated features.

\item A spatio-temporal representation based on the location where an event
takes place, and the locations from where users are commenting about the news
(Chapter~\ref{chapter:geopolitical}).
%
With this type of representation, we can compare events and locations based on
different factors, and track the evolution of an event based on the locations
involved in it.

\item A lightweight representation of content based on shared URLs
(Chapter~\ref{chapter:url}).
%
This representation consists of aggregation of user posts based on common URLs,
retweets, and replies. 
%
In our preliminary experiments, we observe that the representation is one order
of magnitude smaller than the original data.
%
At the same time, we observe that with our representation we can achieve
comparable clustering results, with a fraction of running time and memory
required.

\item An event collection methodology based on {\em seed news outlets}
(Chapter~\ref{chapter:data}).
%
Given a set of news outlets, every hour we extract the most relevant keywords
from their headlines and use them to retrieve relevant tweets from regular
users.
%
We also made available a dataset of 193 million tweets of $20,000$ news events,
from 2013 to 2015.
\end{enumerate}

Even though the different points of view posed as themes for this project cover
mostly independent approaches of event mining, they have in common the goal of
exploring and studying how different data aggregations can be useful for
extracting useful knowledge from events. 
%
This dissertation can be viewed as an exploration on how different data
aggregation strategies applied to events on social media are useful for easily
extracting knowledge or to serve as building blocks for new models and
methodologies.

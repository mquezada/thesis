In this chapter, we presented a lightweight representation to represent newsworthy
information in social media, and a methodology to generate a representation from
a set of social media messages. 
%
Our representation leverages the use of shared URLs in the context of news
events to aggregate common information across messages, and allows us to
identify sub-topics in an event much faster than traditional or off-the-self
methods.
%
We observed that our representation is capable to preserve topical information
of an event.
%
At the same time, it is suitable to be significantly smaller than the original
dataset, requiring much less computational resources to perform standard tasks.
%
This representation requires little data preprocessing, meaning that is
convenient to use in an scenario of having large, raw, uncurated data.
%
However, there is room for improvement in terms of the results.
%
For this, we need to perform a large scale evaluation, although it is hard to
find ground truth data for large, raw, un-curated social media
messages~\cite{Alonso:2015:WCW:2740908.2745397}.
%
For this case scenario, our methodology aims to help processing large quantities
of noisy, un-curated data around news events more effectively.
%
In future work we are interested in studying how to formally define and identify
topic-specific URLs in the events, which we believe are key to creating a useful
representation.
%
%We are also interested in looking for different strategies to represent
%topics in news events by aggregating content using external URLs on social media.

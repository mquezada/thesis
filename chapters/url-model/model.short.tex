\section{Event Representation}\label{sec:model}

We introduce our model and the methodology for applying it to messages that
describe events in social media.

% We introduce a scalable high-level news event representation from microblog data, leveraging
% social media features such as redundancy. Specifically, we define our
% representation and some possible applications.
% The key idea of our representation is to leverage redundancy, common information
% across messages, to reduce the amount of resulting documents while increasing
% the effectiveness of the corpus.
% %, and to be able to easily identify different aspects of an event. 
% For that, we use the shared URLs as clues to aggregate messages into a single
% {\em document}. Our assumption is that the content of the messages that mention
% the same URLs refer to the same aspect of an event. For example, if an URL
% points to an image of a destroyed building (e.g., in the context of an
% earthquake), then it is highly likely that the text of all the messages
% containing that URL will refer to the building and not to a different topic. We
% say that the text in those messages is a {\em surrogate} of the content in the
% URL. This allows us to annotate multimedia content using social media
% information. At the same time, we can reduce the amount of messages by
% aggregating them into a single document, resulting in a more scalable
% representation. 
% We also incorporate other social interactions, such as forward or reply
% messages. For example, in Twitter they are called {\em retweets} and replies,
% respectively. The assumption is similar, and the action of forwarding or
% replying a message can be seen as sharing the URL of the message being
% forwarded or replied, as well.


% Idea: presentar el modelo con la suposicion de que las URLs que tenemos son las
% buenas, es decir, identifican "bien" un topico del evento, a diferencia de las
% urls que no (las que tienen mucho grado en el grafo de coocurrencia). Luego, en
% la metodologia, mostrar una forma de identificar las urls buenas usando el graof
% de coocurrencia.
% tres tipos de urls: "especificas" (topic-specific), generales e irrelevantes

%\paragraph{\bf{Representation definition}}

Our model is based on the assumption that {\em most of the social media posts
that discuss a specific event and contain a URL, are messages that cover a
particular portion or sub-topic of the event}.
%
For example, in the case of an earthquake, tweets that refer to damages to
buildings may share a URL to an external news report; similarly, a tweet that
discusses the magnitude of the event may link to the official seismological
report.
%
We define an event as a tuple $\mathcal{E} = (M, U)$, where $M$ is the set of
messages that discuss a real-world occurrence, and $U$ is
the set of {\em topic-specific} URLs that are mentioned or shared by messages in
$M$. 
%
We denote the URLs $U$ as {\em topic-specific}, assuming that each URL in $U$
identifies only one of the different topics within the real-world event.
%
Our representation is a graph $\mathcal{G} = (V, E)$, where $V \subseteq M \cup
U$ is the set of nodes, comprised of {\em messages} and {\em URLs}, and there is
an edge $(i, j) \in E$ if at least one of the following conditions hold: (1)
$m=i$ is a message and $u=j$ is a URL and $m$ shares $u$, (2) $m_1=i$ and
$m_2=j$ are messages and $m_1$ re-shares $m_2$, or (3) $m_1=i$ and $m_2=j$ are
messages and $m_1$ replies to $m_2$ (see an example in
Figure~\ref{fig:model-example}).
%
Finally, a {\em document} is a connected component of $\mathcal{G}$.
%
In this case, a document is defined as a collection of messages that discuss
only one aspect of the event.

%%

The assumption of $U$ to be a set of topic-specific URLs may not hold in all
cases, for example, for URLs that address general aspects of an event (e.g., a
summary report of an entire event), or that are generic (e.g., refer to a online
news website's root URL), or irrelevant to the event (e.g., spam, or unrelated
information).
%
We deal with these cases in our methodology for generating event models,
presented below.
% In other cases, a message could share more than one URL, and the two of them can
% be complementary, for example, sharing a news report along with a relevant image
% or video.
%
In that sense, our model and methodology focus on identifying URLs that are
specific to one aspect of an event, and use those URLs to aggregate similar
messages.
%
Our goal is to represent underlying sub-topics of an event by just using shared
URLs.

Tambien hay que decir que en realidad una componente se entiende como elementos que hablan de lo mismo y por eso se modelan como un unico documento. El resto de identificar urls problematicas esta bien que quede en la metodologia.}

%\paragraph{\bf{Generation methodology}}\label{sec:methodology}

\subsection*{Methodology for representing events}

Given a set of event-related social media messages, we propose the following
methodology for representation generation:
  
{\bf Filter out generic URLs:} 
%
We call generic URLs (too general with respect to the event) as those that
co-occur with multiple different other URLs across many messages.
%
A URL co-occur with another one URL if they both are shared by the same message.
%
Highly connected URLs are assumed to not contribute information to specific topics: 
links that are very generic (e.g., {\tt cnn.com}) or very general to the event 
(e.g., general reports). 
%
All of the messages mentioning these URLs would fall into the same component,
regardless of their differences in content. 
%
We removed URLs that co-occurred with three or more different URLs across
messages.
%
This threshold yielded the best results in our case studies.


{\bf Representation generation:} 
%
The generation step consists of grouping messages that end up in the same
component, as described in the previous section.
%
For that, a straightforward method is to compute all pairs of messages and pairs
of URLs and messages that fulfill the conditions stated in the representation
definition and then find connected components using a union-find algorithm.
%
The URLs are the non-generic ones identified in the previous step, as an
approximation to the topic-specific URLs.


{\bf Vector representation of documents:} 
%
Finally, we aggregate messages into documents in order to produce a vector
representation, using neural network-based word embeddings.
%
This procedure generates dense document representations.
%
To aggregate messages, we simple compute a vector representation of each word in every message and 
then aggregate all the vectors (for example, using the mean or the sum of all vectors).




% Our goal is to propose a methodology for generating automatic summaries from
% news events on Twitter, exploiting both the multimedia content and the
% importance that users give to certain topics. For that, we learned a
% representation of the URLs shared from event-related tweets (URLs pointing to
% images, videos, other tweets, or other Web pages in general), using the text in
% the tweets that surround those URLs, borrowing the idea of anchor texts in query
% log mining. We used this representation to group the URLs into clusters and then
% used the social features of each tweet in order to rank the URLs and the
% clusters, based on the level of activity that users had on each of those. This
% allowed us to sort the different aspects of an event based on the importance
% that users give to them.



% \subsection{Definitions}

% \paragraph{Tweet} A {em tweet} can be seen as a struct with the following fields:

% \begin{itemize} \item {\em text}: the textual content of the tweet. \item {\em creation\_date}: a
% timestamp when the tweet was published. \item {\em no\_retweets}: the amount of times that tweet was
% shared or       forwarded by other users. \item {\em no\_likes}: the amount of times users ``liked''
% the tweet. \item {\em user}: an identifier of the user who published the tweet. \end{itemize}


% \paragraph{Summary} Given a set of tweets $E = \{t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_N\}$, called an {\em   event},
% we want to select a subset $S \subseteq E$ of tweets, called   a {\em summary}. The summary must
% fulfill the following criteria:

% \begin{itemize}      
% \item {\bf Topical coverage}: the tweets in $S$ must cover the same topics as
% $E$.   \item {\bf Redundancy}: the content of tweets in $S$ must not be redundant with each other.

% \item {\bf Importance}: the tweets in $S$ must be the top $|S|$, with respect to $E$, according to a
% pre-defined ranking function, considering into account the previous two criteria. For example, if
% two tweets have the same value according to the ranking, but     the two of them are equal in terms
% of content, then only one of them should be in $S$.   

% \item {\bf Human-manageable size}: the size of
% $S$ must be of much less size than $E$, only if $E$ is large. {\bf (TODO: define what is ``large''
% and how less is ``less.'')} \end{itemize}

% \paragraph{Replies and retweets} We denote by $\mathit{URL}(t) = \{u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_m\}$ the URLs
% shared by the tweet $t$. $\mathit{URL}(t)$ is empty if $t$ does not share any URL.

% We also denote by $\mathit{replies}(t)$ the set of all tweets $t'$ such that $t'$ is a {\em reply}
% of $t$, or $t'$ is a reply of another tweet in $\mathit{replies}(t)$. The same applies to
% $\mathit{retweets}(t)$, but by considering {\em retweets} instead of replies.

% \paragraph{Document} We now define a {\em document} $d_u$ as a set of tweets, such that those tweets
% share the same URL $u$, plus their replies and retweets, that is,



% Note that a tweet $t$ can be a member of different documents, if $t$ shares more than one URL.


% \subsection{Methodology}

% We make use of the context of multiple tweets in order to arrange them into topically similar
% groups. When a tweet shares an URL $u$, the content of the tweet can be seen as a description (or
% {\em anchor text}) or a comment on the content of $u$. This also applies when a tweet is a {\em
% reply} of another tweet: those two tweets (the reply and the replied) are topically similar, because
% both of them refers to the same subject of discussion. We use this context to group tweets into
% documents.

% Given an event $E$, let $U$ be the set of all the URLs shared across tweets in $E$. The documents
% induced by $U$ are all the subsets of tweets that share at least one URL, $D = \{d_u\ :\ u \in U\}$.
% Our goal is to select representative tweets to create $S$, by using $D$ as a proxy by grouping
% similar tweets into documents.

% One main task is to compare documents. Two documents whose content is topically similar should be
% similar according to the features of its constituents. Note that the documents may have very
% different sizes, and it is possible that two different documents are topically similar. This makes
% comparing documents a difficult task.

% By comparing documents, our goal is to discover sub-topics inside $E$, in order to achieve coverage
% in the resulting summary. Possible implementations for sub-topic identification are clustering (e.g.
% K-Means, K-Medoids, hierarchical, or online/incremental), or process an induced graph from the
% documents (e.g. community detection, connected components, or centrality measures). Another
% alternative, which does not require computing a similarity measure between documents, is the use of
% topic modelling (LDA or Dynamic Topic Models if the time dimension is considered).


% \paragraph{Similarity between documents}

% There are two alternatives when computing similarity between documents:

% \begin{enumerate} \item {\em Consider all the elements of a document as a single element.} For
% example, compute a vector space model (e.g. tf-idf) over the concatenation of tweets in a document
% and then compare the representations using standard cosine similarity. A problem with this approach
% is that diverse content inside a document can be shadowed by the most popular content inside a
% document. Or, on the other hand, if there is a lot of diverse content, then the focus of the
% document can be inaccurate, compared by a smaller, focused document.

% \item {\em Consider each element of a document as a single element.} For example, compare individual
% pairs of tweets of different documents, and then compute an average of similarities to assess the
% similarity of the two documents. This could share a similar problem with the other alternative, as
% diverse content may diffuse the main focus of a document (or be shadowed by the popular content).
% Another alternative is to derive high similarity between unequally-sized documents if {\em some} of
% the tweets in the larger document are {\em very} similar to the tweets in the smaller one.

% Another problem is the sparsity of vocabulary of tweets, if we compare them one by one. But this can
% be settled by using more information about the tweets (for example, by using a word embedding to
% compute similarity between words). \end{enumerate}

% The second approach may be better adjusted to the specific domain, where certain topics of an event
% are way more popular than the rest.

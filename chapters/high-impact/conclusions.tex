\section{Conclusion}

We study the characteristics of the activity that real-world news produces in
the Twitter social network. 
%
In particular, we propose to measure the impact of the real-world news event on
the on-line social network by modeling the user activity related to the event
using the distribution of their interarrival times between consecutive messages.
%
In our research we observe that the activity triggered by real-world news events
follows a similar pattern to that observed in other types of collective
reactions to events. 
%
This is, by displaying periods of intense activity as well as long periods of
inactivity.
%
We further extend this analysis by identifying groups of events that produce
much more concentration of high-activity than other events. 
%
We show that there are several specific properties that distinguish how
high-activity events evolve in Twitter, when comparing them to other events. 
%
We design a model for events, based on the codebook approach, that allows us to
do unambiguous classification of high-activity events based on the impact
displayed by social network. 
%
This definition does not have some of the problems that current notions of
virality and popularity have. 
%
Some notable characteristics of high-activity events are that they are forwarded
more often by users, and generate a greater amount of conversation than other
events.
%
Social media posts from high-activity news events are much more focused on the
news topic. 
%
Our experiments show that there are several properties that can suggest early on
if an event will have high-activity on the on-line community. 
%
We can predict a high number of high-activity events {\em before} the network
has shown any type of explosive reaction to them. 
%
Using simple off-the-shelf feature based classifiers, we can predict many
high-impact events with high precision. 
%
This suggests that users are collectively quick at deciding whether an event
should receive priority or not. 
%
However, there does exist a fraction of events which will create high activity,
despite not presenting patterns of other high activity events during their early
stages.
%
These events are likely to be affected by other factors, such as random
conditions found in the social network at the moment and require further
investigation.

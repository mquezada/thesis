\section{Results and Discussion}

Our main objective in this work is to analyze the characteristics of
high-activity events which differentiate them from other types of events. 
%
In particular, we identify how early on in an event's lifecycle can we determine
if an event is going produce high activity in the on-line social network.


\input{chapters/high-impact/events_example_PLOS_revision.tex}

Tables~\ref{table:high-impact-sample} and~\ref{table:low-impact-sample} show
examples of events from the high-activity category and low-activity category. 
%
We recall that the high-activity events are those which were in the top 8\% of
the ranking obtained by sorting the event clusters according to concentration of
interarrival times of social media posts in the shortest interarrival time of
the VQ-event model.  
%
Table \ref{table:high-impact-sample} shows two events of different sizes (large
and small) and different scopes (one global and the other of more local scope)
categorized as high activity in our dataset. 
%
The first event, the death of Nelson Mandela, is one of the largest events in
the dataset, with $\approx 134,000$ tweets. 
%
The histogram representation of this event, shown in
Fig~\ref{fig:hi:example-mandela}, suggests that more than $80\%$ of the activity
of the event was produced in high-activity periods.
%
This is an event of international, political, and social importance, that
produced an overwhelming flood of messages on social media. %% add detail about reach and scope
%
Hence, it makes sense for such an example to be a high-activity event. 
%
The second event, on the other hand, about the 2013 Mumbai Gang Rape is of much
smaller scale, with a total of $\approx 1,700$ tweets. 
%
However, this event caused considerable amount of immediate reaction on social
media, with close to $50\%$ of its activity concentrated within high-activity
periods. 
%
Despite its smaller size, in comparison to the previous event, this event
displays a similar reaction to that of other high-activity events, but at a
smaller scale. 
%
More detailed inspection of the event shows that geo-located users which
discussed this event were mostly from India and the U.K. 
%
In addition, we find that in the following days other events that are
repercussions of this event gather a great deal of attention (with $\approx
12,700$ tweets).


Table \ref{table:low-impact-sample} shows events that have been classified by
our methodology in the category of low activity. 
%
The first event, about a teen surviving after hiding in the wheel of a airplane,
had only a little more than $25\%$ of its messages arriving with high-activity
bursts although it had over $18,000$ messages.  
%
The second event, about the damages caused by a tornado in Canada, did not
garner much immediacy in attention of Twitter users, with only $7\%$ of its
messages produced with short interarrival times. 
%
Most of the messages of this event were well spaced out in time. 
%
Even though we cannot say whether or not this event had significant implications
in the real-world, we can say that it did not have considerable impact on the
Twitter network. 
%
The lack of interest could be due to several factors that are currently beyond
the scope of this work, ranging from the lack of Twitter users in the locality
of the real-world event, to it not being considered urgent by Twitter users. 
%
We intend to research the relation between the real-world impact of an event and
the network reaction in future work.

Figure~\ref{fig:hi:avg-hist} shows the average histograms for events that belong
to the high activity, medium-high activity, medium-low activity and low-activity
clusters (displayed from left to right and top to bottom). 
%
All histograms show a quick decay in average relative frequency (resembling a
distribution from the exponential family). 
%
In particular, the high-activity group concentrates most of its activity in the
shortest interarrival rate, with lower activity groups mostly concentrating
their activity in the second bin with slower decay. 
%
Figure~\ref{fig:hi:scatter} further characterizes the differences in behavior of
the high and low-activity groups, showing that high-activity events concentrate
on average $70\%$ fo their activity in the smallest bin ($0$ sec.), against
$8\%$ for low-activity events. 
%
In addition, Figure~\ref{fig:hi:cdf} (left) shows the cumulative distribution
function (CDF) for each group of events, and Figure~\ref{fig:hi:cdf} (right)
shows $\log{(1 - \mathrm{CDF})}$. 
%
Visual inspection shows a clear difference in how interarrival rates are
distributed within each group, however, these figures do not indicate a
power-law distribution nor exponential distribution.%%

Further analysis of the high-activity events shows significant differences to
other events, in the following aspects: 
%
(i) how the information about these events is propagated, 
%
(ii) the characteristics of the conversations that they generate, and 
%
(iii) how focused users are on the news topic. 
%
In detail, high-activity events have a higher fraction of {\em retweets} (or
shares) relative to their overall message volume. 
%
On average, a tweet from a high-activity event is retweeted 2.36 times more than
a tweet from a low activity event. 
%
The most retweeted message in high-activity events is retweeted 7 times more
than the most retweeted message in a medium or low activity event. 
%
We find that a small set of initial social media posts are propagated quickly
and extensively through the network without any rephrasing by the user (just
plain forwarding). 
%
Intuitively, this seems justified given general topic urgency of high-activity
events. 
%
Events that are not high-activity did not exhibit these characteristics.

%%

Our research also revealed that high-activity events tend to spark more
conversation between users, 33.4\% more than other events. 
%
This is reflected in the number of {\em replies} to social media posts. 
%
The number of different users that engage with high-activity events is 32.7\%
higher than in events that are not high-activity. 
%
Posts about high-activity events are much more topic focused than in other
events. 
%
The vocabulary of unique words as well as {\em hashtags} used in high-activity
events is much more narrow than for other events. 
%
Medium and low activity events have over 7 times more unique hashtags than
high-activity events. 
%
This is intuitive, given that if a news item is sensational, people will seldom
deviate from the main conversation topic.

%%

In a real-world scenario, in order to predict if an early breaking news story
will have a considerable impact in the social network, we will not have enough
data to create its activity-based model, i.e., we will not yet know the
distribution of the speed at which the social media posts will arrive for the
event. 
%
For instance, an event can start slowly and later produce an explosive reaction,
or start explosively and decay quickly to an overall slower message arrival
rate. 
%
Still, reliable early prediction of very high-activity news is important in many
aspects, from decisions of mass media information coverage, to natural disaster
management, brand and political image monitoring, and so on.

%%

For the task of early prediction of high-activity events we use features that
are independent of our activity-based model such as the retweets, the sentiment
of the posts about the event, etc. These features are computed on the early 5\%
of messages about the event.
%
The results are an average from a 5-fold cross validation with randomly selected
60\% training, 20\% validation and 20\% test splits. 
%
The high-activity events are identified with a precision of 82\% using only the
earliest 5\% of the data of each event (Table~\ref{tab:classification_results}).
%
Additionally, we were able to identify with high accuracy a considerable
percentage of all high-activity events ($\approx 46\%$) at an early stage, with
very few false positives (Table~\ref{tab:classification_results}
and~\ref{tab:confusion_matrix}).

The precision using only the early tweets is almost as good as using all tweets
in the event (0.819 to 0.830). 
%
This suggests that the social network somehow acts as a natural filter in
separating out the high-activity events fairly early on.  
%
The recall goes from 0.455 to 0.540. 
%
This indicates that there are some high-activity events which require more data
in order to determine what kind of activity they will produce, or events for
which activity occurs due to random conditions.

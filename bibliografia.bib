abstract = {The explosive use of social media also makes it a popular platform for malicious users, known as social spammers, to overwhelm normal users with unwanted content. One effective way for social spammer detection is to build a classifier based on content and social network information. However, social spammers are sophisticated and adaptable to game the system with fast evolving content and network patterns. First, social spammers continually change their spamming content patterns to avoid being detected. Second, reflexive reciprocity makes it easier for social spammers to establish social influence and pretend to be normal users by quickly accumulating a large number of "human" friends. It is challenging for existing anti-spamming systems based on batch-mode learning to quickly respond to newly emerging patterns for effective social spammer detection. In this paper, we present a general optimization framework to collectively use content and network information for social spammer detection, and provide the solution for efficient online processing. Experimental results on Twitter datasets confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.},

abstract = {Web-based social systems enable new community-based opportunities for participants to engage, share, and interact. This community value and related services like search and advertising are threatened by spammers, content polluters, and malware disseminators. In an effort to preserve community value and ensure longterm success, we propose and evaluate a honeypot-based approach for uncovering social spammers in online social systems. Two of the key components of the proposed approach are: (1) The deployment of social honeypots for harvesting deceptive spam profiles from social networking communities; and (2) Statistical analysis of the properties of these spam profiles for creating spam classifiers to actively filter out existing and new spammers. We describe the conceptual framework and design considerations of the proposed approach, and we present concrete observations from the deployment of social honeypots in MySpace and Twitter. We find that the deployed social honeypots identify social spammers with low false positive rates and that the harvested spam data contains signals that are strongly correlated with observable profile features (e.g., content, friend information, posting patterns, etc.). Based on these profile features, we develop machine learning based classifiers for identifying previously unknown spammers with high precision and a low rate of false positives.},

abstract = {Social networking has become a popular way for users to meet and interact online. Users spend a significant amount of time on popular social network platforms (such as Facebook, MySpace, or Twitter), storing and sharing a wealth of personal information. This information, as well as the possibility of contacting thousands of users, also attracts the interest of cybercriminals. For example, cybercriminals might exploit the implicit trust relationships between users in order to lure victims to malicious websites. As another example, cybercriminals might find personal information valuable for identity theft or to drive targeted spam campaigns.In this paper, we analyze to which extent spam has entered social networks. More precisely, we analyze how spammers who target social networking sites operate. To collect the data about spamming activity, we created a large and diverse set of "honey-profiles" on three large social networking sites, and logged the kind of contacts and messages that they received. We then analyzed the collected data and identified anomalous behavior of users who contacted our profiles. Based on the analysis of this behavior, we developed techniques to detect spammers in social networks, and we aggregated their messages in large spam campaigns. Our results show that it is possible to automatically identify the accounts used by spammers, and our analysis was used for take-down efforts in a real-world social network. More precisely, during this study, we collaborated with Twitter and correctly detected and deleted 15,857 spam profiles.},

abstract = {Social media for news consumption is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, its low cost, easy access, and rapid dissemination of information lead people to seek out and consume news from social media. On the other hand, it enables the wide spread of fake news", i.e., low quality news with intentionally false information. The extensive spread of fake news has the potential for extremely negative impacts on individuals and society. Therefore, fake news detection on social media has recently become an emerging research that is attracting tremendous attention. Fake news detection on social media presents unique characteristics and challenges that make existing detection algorithms from traditional news media ine ective or not applicable. First, fake news is intentionally written to mislead readers to believe false information, which makes it difficult and nontrivial to detect based on news content; therefore, we need to include auxiliary information, such as user social engagements on social media, to help make a determination. Second, exploiting this auxiliary information is challenging in and of itself as users' social engagements with fake news produce data that is big, incomplete, unstructured, and noisy. Because the issue of fake news detection on social media is both challenging and relevant, we conducted this survey to further facilitate research on the problem. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of detecting fake news on social media, including fake news characterizations on psychology and social theories, existing algorithms from a data mining perspective, evaluation metrics and representative datasets. We also discuss related research areas, open problems, and future research directions for fake news detection on social media.},

Studying the characteristics of such popular messages is important for a number of tasks, such as breaking news detection, personalized message recommendation, viral marketing and others. This paper investigates the problem of predicting the popularity of messages as measured by the number of future retweets and sheds some light on what kinds of factors influence information propagation in Twitter. We formulate the task into a classification problem and study two of its variants by investigating a wide spectrum of features based on the content of the messages, temporal information, metadata of messages and users, as well as structural properties of the users' social graph on a large scale dataset. We show that our method can successfully predict messages which will attract thousands of retweets with good performance.},

Tweets are propagated using a variety of channels: by following users or lists, by searching or by retweeting. Of these vectors, retweeting is arguably the most effective, as it can potentially reach the most people, given its viral nature. A key task is predicting if a tweet will be retweeted, and solving this problem furthers our understanding of message propagation within large user communities. We carry out a human experiment on the task of deciding whether a tweet will be retweeted which shows that the task is possible, as human performance levels are much above chance. Using a machine learning approach based on the passive-aggressive algorithm, we are able to automatically predict retweets as well as humans. Analyzing the learned model, we find that performance is dominated by social features, but that tweet features add a substantial boost.},

This idea, combined with another that says that text in, and possibly around, HTML anchors describe the pages to which they point, is the foundation for a usable World-Wide Web. In this paper, we examine to what extent these ideas hold by empirically testing whether topical locality mirrors spatial locality of pages on the Web. In particular, we find that the likelihood of linked pages having similar textual content to be high; the similarity of sibling pages increases when the links from the parent are close together; titles, descriptions, and anchor text represent at least part of the target page; and that anchor text may be a useful discriminator among unseen child pages. These results show the foundations necessary for the success of many web systems, including search engines, focused crawlers, linkage analyzers, and intelligent web agents.},

The clustering process uses the content of historical preferences of users registered in the query log of the search engine.

	abstract = {During natural and man-made disasters, people use social media platforms such as Twitter to post textual and multimedia content to report updates about injured or dead people, infrastructure damage, missing or found people, among other information types. Studies have revealed that this online information, if processed timely and effectively, is extremely useful for humanitarian organizations to gain situational awareness and plan relief operations. In addition to the analysis of textual content, recent studies have shown that imagery content on social media can boost disaster response significantly. Despite extensive research that mainly focuses on textual content to extract useful information, limited work has focused on the use of imagery content or the combination of both content types. One of the reasons is the lack of labeled imagery data in this domain. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to tackle this limitation by releasing a large multi-modal dataset from natural disasters collected from Twitter. We provide three types of annotations, which are useful to address a number of crisis response and management tasks for different humanitarian organizations.},

  abstract = {Magneto- and electroencephalography (M/EEG) measure the electromagnetic
	fields produced by the neural electrical currents. Given a conductor
	model for the head, and the distribution of source currents in the
	brain, Maxwell's equations allow one to compute the ensuing M/EEG
	signals. Given the actual M/EEG measurements and the solution of
	this forward problem, one can localize, in space and in time, the
	brain regions that have produced the recorded data. However, due
	to the physics of the problem, the limited number of sensors compared
	to the number of possible source locations, and measurement noise,
	this inverse problem is ill-posed. Consequently, additional constraints
	are needed. Classical inverse solvers, often called minimum norm
	estimates (MNE), promote source estimates with a small \ell(2) norm.
	Here, we consider a more general class of priors based on mixed norms.
	Such norms have the ability to structure the prior in order to incorporate
	some additional assumptions about the sources. We refer to such solvers
	as mixed-norm estimates (MxNE). In the context of M/EEG, MxNE can
	promote spatially focal sources with smooth temporal estimates with
	a two-level \ell(1)/\ell(2) mixed-norm, while a three-level mixed-norm
	can be used to promote spatially non-overlapping sources between
	different experimental conditions. In order to efficiently solve
	the optimization problems of MxNE, we introduce fast first-order
	iterative schemes that for the \ell(1)\ell(2) norm give solutions
	in a few seconds making such a prior as convenient as the simple
	MNE. Furthermore, thanks to the convexity of the optimization problem,
	we can provide optimality conditions that guarantee global convergence.
	The utility of the methods is demonstrated both with simulations
	and experimental MEG data.},

	such high-density clusters-other standard hierarchical techniques,
	such as average and complete linkage, are hopelessly inconsistent
	for these clusters. The asymptotic consistency of single linkage
	closely depends on the percolation problem of Broadbent and Hammersley-if
	small spheres are removed at random from a solid, at which density
	of spheres will water begin to flow through the solid? If there is
	a single critical density such that no flow takes place below a certain
	density, and flow occurs through a single connected set above that
	density, then single linkage is consistent in separating high-density
	clusters (by disjoint single-linkage clusters that include a positive
	fraction of sample points in the respective clusters and pass arbitrarily
	close to all points in the respective clusters). The existence of
	a single critical point remains a conjecture. A weaker result is
	proved that shows that single-linkage clusters detect high-density
	clusters if there is a low enough valley separating them.},

	the dominant features used for speech recognition- and investigate
	their applicability to modeling music. In particular, we examine
	two of the main assumptions of the process of forming MFCCs: the
	use of the Mel frequency scale to model the spectra; and the use
	of the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to decorrelate the Mel-spectral
	vectors. We examine the first assumption in the context of speech/music
	discrimination. Our results show that the use of the Mel scale for
	modeling music is at least not harmful for this problem, although
	further experimentation is needed to verify that this is the optimal
	scale in the general case. We investigate the second assumption by
	examining the basis vectors of the theoretically optimal transform
	to decorrelate music and speech spectral vectors. Our results demonstrate
	that the use of the DCT to decorrelate vectors is appropriate for
	both speech and music spectra.},

	data, however, interpretation of their results has been hindered

	such as its retrieval of inherent structure, its sensitivity to resampling
	and the stability of its results in the light of new data. These
	criteria depend on a measure of similarity between two different
	clusterings of the same set of data; the measure essentially considers
	how each pair of data points is assigned in each clustering.},

  abstract = {{Summary.  We consider the problem of selecting grouped variables
	(factors) for accurate prediction in regression. Such a problem arises
	naturally in many practical situations with the multifactor analysis-of-variance
	problem as the most important and well-known example. Instead of
	selecting factors by stepwise backward elimination, we focus on the
	accuracy of estimation and consider extensions of the lasso, the
	LARS algorithm and the non-negative garrotte for factor selection.
	The lasso, the LARS algorithm and the non-negative garrotte are recently
	proposed regression methods that can be used to select individual
	variables. We study and propose efficient algorithms for the extensions
	of these methods for factor selection and show that these extensions
	give superior performance to the traditional stepwise backward elimination
	method in factor selection problems. We study the similarities and
	the differences between these methods. Simulations and real examples
	are used to illustrate the methods.}},

abstract="Social media platforms have democratized the process of web content creation allowing mere consumers to become creators and distributors of content. But this has also contributed to an explosive growth of information and has intensified the online competition for users attention, since only a small number of items become popular while the rest remain unknown. Understanding what makes one item more popular than another, observing its popularity dynamics, and being able to predict its popularity has thus attracted a lot of interest in the past few years. Predicting the popularity of web content is useful in many areas such as network dimensioning (e.g., caching and replication), online marketing (e.g., recommendation systems and media advertising), or real-world outcome prediction (e.g., economical trends). In this survey, we review the current findings on web content popularity prediction. We describe the different popularity prediction models, present the features that have shown good predictive capabilities, and reveal factors known to influence web content popularity.",

volume="8",
number="1",
pages="3",
abstract="The Modified Mercalli intensity scale (Mercalli scale for short) is a qualitative measure used to express the perceived intensity of an earthquake in terms of damages. Accurate intensity reports are vital to estimate the type of emergency response required for a particular earthquake. In addition, Mercalli scale reports are needed to estimate the possible consequences of strong earthquakes in the future, based on the effects of previous events. Emergency offices and seismological agencies worldwide are in charge of producing Mercalli scale reports for each affected location after an earthquake. However, this task relies heavily on human observers in the affected locations, who are not always available or accurate. Consequently, Mercalli scale reports may take up to hours or even days to be published after an earthquake. We address this problem by proposing a method for early prediction of spatial Mercalli scale reports based on people's reactions to earthquakes in social networks. By tracking users' comments about real-time earthquakes, we create a collection of Mercalli scale point estimates at municipality (i.e., state subdivisions) level granularity. We introduce the concept of reinforced Mercalli support, which combines Mercalli scale point estimates with locally supported data (named `local support'). We use this concept to provide Mercalli scale estimates for real-world events by providing smooth point estimates using a spatial smoother that incorporates the distribution of municipalities in each affected region. Our method is the first method based on social media that can provide spatial reports of damages in the Mercalli intensity scale. Experimental results show that our method is accurate and provides early spatial Mercalli reports 30 minutes after an earthquake. Furthermore, we show that our method performs well for earthquake spatial detection and maximum intensity prediction tasks. Our findings indicate that social media is a valuable source of spatial information for quickly estimating earthquake damages.",

    abstract = { The proliferation of social networking services has resulted in a rapid growth of their user base, spanning across the world. The collective information generated from these online platforms is overwhelming, in terms of both the amount of content produced every moment and the diversity of topics discussed. The real-time nature of the information produced by users has prompted researchers to analyse this content, in order to gain timely insight into the current state of affairs. Specifically, the microblogging service Twitter has been a recent focus of researchers to gather information on events occurring in real time. This article presents a survey of a wide variety of event detection methods applied to streaming Twitter data, classifying them according to shared common traits, and then discusses different aspects of the subtasks and challenges involved in event detection. We believe this survey will act as a guide and starting point for aspiring researchers to gain a structured view on state-of-the-art real-time event detection and spur further research in this direction. }

abstract="Social media play a decisive role in communicating and spreading information during global events. In particular, real-time microblogging platforms such as Twitter have become prevalent. Researchers have used microblogging for a number of tasks, including past events analysis, predictions, and information retrieval. Nevertheless, little attention has been given to quantitative data extraction. In this paper, we address two questions: can we develop a mechanism to extract quantitative data from a collection of tweets, and can we use the salient findings to describe an event? To answer the first question, we introduce Raimond, a virtual text curator, specialized in quantitative data extraction from Twitter. To address the second question, we use our system on three events and evaluate its output using a crowdsourcing strategy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with a number of real world examples.",
